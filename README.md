# Friends Trail Map
 
This is the repository for the new Friends Trail map 

# Product Vision
The Friends Trail Map is a Single Page Application (SPA) created for the Friends of Mount Edgcumbe, which allows visitors easy exploration of the area and donations to be made to the charity. Friends of Mount Edgcumbe have devised two walking trails: a shorter 1.5-mile trail and a longer 3-mile trail. The Friends Trail Map will allow visitors to follow the designated trails, and when they reach a point of interest, read more information about the preservations and enhancements that have been made. This SPA will be created due to the planned leaflets only having limited space for text, whereas the web application will be able to show an abundance of information. This will enhance visitor interactivity, and with the Park Managers permission, sufficiently sized QR codes will be placed which are scannable into the application, allowing quick and easy access to the information that is available. The SPA will also encourage donations to the Friends of Mount Edgcumbe charity, allowing them to continue their preservations and enhancements of the area.
